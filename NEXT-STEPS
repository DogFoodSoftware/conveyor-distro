== Setup Admin (Virtual) Host ==

Add 'admin' VirtualHost on port 443 to apache. This points to nix
installation of conveyor core and redirects '/' to '/hosts/self'. It
is also always the default VirtualHost as required by the Conveyor
spec.

Initially, this just lists active services and hosted sites. The admin
server is fully controled by Conveyor and may be used to manually
administer, but also works with and to enable environments.

Then integrate the LL theme into the less build.

Integrate grunt / less into minify.

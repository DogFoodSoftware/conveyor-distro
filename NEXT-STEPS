== Setup Admin (Virtual) Host ==

For development, generate virtual host config that maps requests to
development directory.

Under 'conveyor/distro' add 'conveyor-environments' package. For now,
downloads from github project distro master branch. By 0.1, that will
change to release branch.

Under 'conveyor/environment' project:

- Setup up admin web server virtual host configuration. This is
  sym-linked into the .conveyor/data/distro/conf/admin-host.httpd
  file. The symlink is directly referenced from the conveyor-apache
  httpd.conf file. This is distinct from the 'runtime-conf' directory.
  The admin config is loaded first, making it the default
  virtualhost. It listens on *:443.

- In admin server, map '/hosts' using standard implementation
  mappings.

- In admin server, redirect '/' to '/hosts/self'.

- Work out and documentent initial site layout.
  '.conveyor/data/sites/xxxx'. For development sites, 'xxxx' is a
  symlink to the playground checkout. For packaged sites, it's the
  actual site data. Manually setup 'll' as default HTTP site
  ('__xxx.httpd.conf' convention).

== LL Website ==

Then integrate the LL theme into the less build.

Integrate grunt / less into minify.

To complete distro we need to integrate apache control into conveyor
core. Two steps:

1) Add 'admin' VirtualHost on port 8080 to apache. This points to nix
   installation of conveyor core and redirects '/' to
   '/hosts/self'. Initially, this just lists active services and
   hosted sites. The admin server is fully controled by Conveyor and
   may be used to manually administer, but also works with and to
   enable environments.

2) Support something like:

con PATCH hosts/self '
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/sites",
    "value": {
      "host-name": "liquid-labs.com",
      "source": "$PLAYGROUND/liquid-labs.com/runnable/site"
    }
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/sites",
    "value": { 
      "package-src": "github.com/LiquidLabs/website",
      "version": "5ha2bc21830"
    }
  }
]'

Then integrate the LL theme into the less build.

Integrate grunt / less into minify.

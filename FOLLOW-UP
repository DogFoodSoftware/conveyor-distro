1) Document '/hosts' item data structure.

   - '/hosts/self' special ID replaces 'self' with the
     environment-unique host ID of the host actually processing the
     request. This request /should/ never go beyond first endpoint. At
     the same time users /should/ expect that hosts serving network
     specific functions, such as load balancing or proxying may pass
     the request along. While not desirable, it is effectively
     unavoidable in some configurations.

   - Has 'sites' list of host-site data necessary to tie a site into a
     host. Leaves open but does not define separate '/sites'
     resource. Reference the standard distribution site layout.


2) Support something like:

con PATCH hosts/self '
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/sites",
    "value": {
      "host-name": "liquid-labs.com",
      "source": "$PLAYGROUND/liquid-labs.com/runnable/site"
    }
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/sites",
    "value": { 
      "package-src": "github.com/LiquidLabs/website",
      "version": "5ha2bc21830"
    }
  }
]'

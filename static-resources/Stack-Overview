The main purpose of this distro is to provide a consistent stack for
the Conveyor environment.

Because Conveyor is essentially a REST-ful system, it seem to make a
lot of sense to use a NoSQL / Graph DB that could quickly output and
work with JSON data. The two primary contenders at the time of
evaluation were Neo4j and OrientDB. Both had all the necessary
qualificiations, but we went with OrientDB primarily based this <a
href="http://vschart.com/compare/neo4j/vs/orientdb">analysis</a> that
claimed Neo4j's minimum memory footprint was 2GB, while OrientDB could
start off at a mere 16MB. Since 2GB is the target 'standard' memory
allotment, that would obviously be a problem. Also, overall it seemed
that while they were overall quite similar and Neo4j did have
advantages (not the least of which were community and ecosystem),
OrientDB also had a clearer licensing structure and seemed to edge out
Neo4j on certain technical issues. Also, OrientDB just seems to be
better liked in the head-to-head despite the straight market
share. The OrientDB written comparison of the two is of course not
persuasive on it's own, but the lack of any response by Neo4j or
others (that I was able to find) is, in the absence of primary
evidence, some kind of evidence of it's own.
